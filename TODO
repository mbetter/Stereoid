Add method to add / update album art. maybe: PUT or POST /albums/art. This 
should allow for adding by file upload and adding by url - GET to be 
performed by http client on the server

Last.FM integration - need data structures for storage of metadata. Should 
this be mixed in with local information or separate?

Jobs system - catalog scans, art gathering, exernal api scans will be 
classified as "jobs". These should be started by a POST request to /jobs 
and forked asynchronously. status / results of jobs can be fed to 
persistence layer from the jobs themselves and then retrieved with a GET 
request. 

Authentication - second phase of authentication needs to be implemented. 
all requests that modify data on the server need stronger authentication. 
Current plan is to require the url query string (including a nonce - 
current auth timestamp ok?) be hashed on every such request.

- "remember me" function needs to be added. authenticate method should 
return session token plus a new, one-time use authentication token. 
authentication should accept this new token in lieu of normal 
authentication information, invalidate it and issue a new authentication 
token.
