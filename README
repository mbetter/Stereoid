The goal of the Stereoid project is to create a music management server that:
1) interacts with the world entirely though a REST-ful API 
2) uses HTTP streaming to serve music on demand

By exposing metadata solely through an API, the actual consumption of data should
be very client-agnostic, allowing for easily developed and featureful mobile apps,
web apps, desktop apps, media center plugins, etc. 

This repo also contains a Javascript web client that is being developed in parallel
with the Stereoid server. This may eventually be split off into its own project.

The server is written entirely in Haskell utilizing the Happstack web framework and
Acid-state for data persistence.
